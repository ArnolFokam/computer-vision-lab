## TLDR;

## Problem Indentified
- Self-supervised learning is great but negative sampling is not that great
- How can we improve it?

## Solution proposed 
- A mixing strategy that mix the hardest negatives  in the feature space to form new negative samples.

## Contributions
- This paper proposes a hard negative mixing strategy for self-supervised learning.

## Methodology
- The method samples a set of the hardest negatives from an available set of negative samples
- Synthesizes new negatives through the convex linear combination of different pairs of these sampled negatives

## Findings
- 

## Limitations
- 

## Improvements (sort of)
- 

## Cross-Reference
-
